    Hello, and welcome to our 21 day meditation journey, activating the divine
    feminine. Wow! This is amazing and I'm so excited to invite you to join me
    and Deepak Chopra, my brother, in this adventure. The goal of our three
    weeks together is to find healing in the power of the divine feminine and
    restore wholeness to your life. Right? Donâ€™t we want that? This is so
    important to me because, first of all, it's natural that these energies
    exist within us, and I think, in this world it is obvious that there is an
    imbalance. We can see that for so many years the masculine has taken over
    and the need for the feminine is imperative. We can see it all around us.
    This idea of nurturing and that gentleness, that loving kindness that we all
    have within us is so important. So I think about this a lot, and I really
    want to see more balance, and I know that will solve a lot of things that we
    want to change. Within each of us, and in everything in the universe, there
    are masculine and feminine energies that motivate and support us. The
    feminine is lunar, cooling, and receptive. The masculine is solar, warming,
    and active. We see these complimentary energies in nature and all around us,
    and they have a deep source in our consciousness.
